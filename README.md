# example-vimrc
My current vimrc, posted here for future reference

Update 1: I've stopped using Vundle and NERDTree because I think the less possible failurepoints in my system, the better.
Plus, I've found there's a direct relation between focus, aesthetics, and lack of visual noise when coding.
Plus a very sizeable amount of changes -I've defined several convenient modern-style bindings and mappings for productivity.
